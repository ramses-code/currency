# Currency Exchange
### Video Demo: [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koUg-pQLMi0).

### Description:

Currency Exchange is an application where users can check their preferred value in real-time and exchange currencies. 

Users can create an account, although it is not necessary, only if they want to keep track of their transactions.

### Distinctiveness and Complexity

I believe my application is distinct from the other projects in this course because I have applied more styling to the look of the pages. It is also more complex because it is mobile-responsive and it fetches data from a third-party API.

### Files description

index.js contains the code to make the app interactive and fetch data to the API.
styles.css the image background of the app and some styles.
index.html is the main page of the application.
layout.html has the default layout that is shared among other html files.
login.html contains the login template.
resgister.html contains the register template.
transaction.html is the page where users can stored their transactions.
views.py contains backend code like creating new transactions and users and rendering data to the frontend.

### How to run application

In the currency folder is a project called currency which contains a single app called capstone, simply cd into currency and run the command `python manage.py runserver`
